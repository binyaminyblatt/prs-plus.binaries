Content:
	Runs on Linux machines:
	  cramfs-igorsk - cramfs, originaly modified by igorsk, patched by kartu to work with windows 
					  shortcut files (lnk). Used ON LINUX MACHINES to build PRS+. (mkcramfs cramfsck)
					  
	Runs on Sony Reader:
	  fb2epub - fb2 to epub converter, depends on zlib (needs "flex" installed on the host system)
	  lnkparser - windows shortcut (lnk) parser lib (by kartu) could be used to add windows shortcut support
	  7za - 7 zip 9.20.1, patched to list archive content in PRS+ friendly format
	  unrar - unrar patched to list archive content in PRS+ friendly format
	  dictionary - PRS+ dictionary

Building cramfs:
	Simply execute "make" in corresponding folder
	
Cross-compiling Sony Reader executables:
	1) install / set path to crosscompilers (aka toolchains) in compiler.config (makefiles are configured to compile for both older/newer models, so you need both toolchains). 
		a) 505/300 models need cross compiler based on 2.4 kernel, Available here (to be unpacked to the /):
			http://code.google.com/p/prs-plus/downloads/detail?name=arm-toolchain-sony-300.tar.gz
			(ignore deprecation warning)
		b) 600 and newer models need 2.6. Available here ("installer" executable): 
			http://code.google.com/p/prs-plus/downloads/detail?name=arm-2007q3-51-arm-none-linux-gnueabi.bin
			(ignore deprecation warning)
	3) install flex on the host system (apt-get install flex) you do NOT need cross version of this
	4) copy FlexLexer.h (from host include folder) to cross tools include folder (header is still needed to compile)
	5) cross compile zlib (you need to do it 2 times, once per toolchain):
		a) get/uncompress version 1.2.5 here: http://zlib.net/
		b) set path to point to the right toolchain, e.g.:
			export PATH=/opt/cross/gcc-3.2.3-glibc-2.2.5/arm-unknown-linux-gnu/arm-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/:$PATH
			export PATH=/media/big/sorcery.600/bin:$PATH
		c) set CC var for 600's toolchain (since it needs  arm-none-linux-gnueabi- prefix)
			export CC=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc 
		d) run ./configure with correct prefix, e.g.:
			./configure --prefix=/opt/cross/gcc-3.2.3-glibc-2.2.5/arm-unknown-linux-gnu/arm-unknown-linux-gnu
			./configure --prefix=/media/big/sorcery.600/arm-none-linux-gnueabi
		e) make & make install - this step should create libz.a and copy zlib.h and copy them to toolchain specific folders 
	5) run "make" in the checked out root folder for options
